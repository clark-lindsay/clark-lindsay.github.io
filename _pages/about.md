I'm a software engineer from Michigan, USA. My favorite programming language is [elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), and my other hobbies and interests include (but certainly aren't limited to):

- tabletop RPGs 
- bicycling
- coffee (particularly making espresso)
- urbanism
- video games
- language
- ...

This site is mostly a dev log, but I suspect that some of my other interests will peak into whatever software-related stuff I'm writing up.

I don't use twitter or fediverse apps, mostly because when using them in the past I found that they gave me negative emotions more than half the time that I used them, and I rarely walked away with much useful information. So for better or worse, with the exception of forum posts and github discussions, this is the only place that I plan to do any writing on the internet.
