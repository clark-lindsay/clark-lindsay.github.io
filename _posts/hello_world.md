Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet.

Expect posts primarily about software (I think, anyway) but also about bicycles, coffee, tabletop RPGs, gaming, and maybe some computer builds.

I'm currently working on an exploratory, absolutely-not-intended-for-production implementation of the [Raft protocol](https://raft.github.io/) in Elixir. So hopefully I'll write a post about that once enough of it is working.
